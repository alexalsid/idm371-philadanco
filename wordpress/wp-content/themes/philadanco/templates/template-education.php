Expert teachers from around the world provide training in core dance genres such as ballet and modern dance techniques. The program is provided at no cost to participants, and classes are scheduled Saturday through Wednesday during after-school hours to accommodate students and their families. Participants are given free dancewear, counseling and participate in the annual ‘Danco on ‘Danco Choreographic Showcase Concert. The ‘Danco on ‘Danco Concert allows participants the opportunity to mount works on their fellow dancers, honing their choreographic and performance skills.</p>

                <h3>Arts in Education and Community</h3>
                    <p class="class-desc">Partnering with schools, educational organizations and community-based organizations, PHILADANCO delivers its commitment to delivering community-based arts education through workshops, lecture-demonstrations, master classes and peer-to-peer conferences.</p>

                <h3>Summer Training Program</h3>
                    <img src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri() . '/dist/img/education_03.jpg'?>"  alt="placeholder" style="float: right;">
                    <p class="class-desc">This six-week program provides training in one dance idiom of study per week, such as African, Hip Hop and Jazz. During the months of June, July and August, young pre-professional dancers are introduced to the rigors of dance with special teachers and instructors. Participants are selected through an audition process that takes place annually in June. Dancers attend classes five days per week for 90 minutes per day, plus workshop hours. The program offers nominal tuition rates with the possibility for financial scholarships. Summer program participants travel to local PHILADANCO performances seeing firsthand the working infrastructure of a professional dance company. The ‘Danco on ‘Danco Choreographic Showcase Concert is held at the conclusion of the Summer Intensive Program at the Painted Bride Arts Center in Philadelphia.</p>
